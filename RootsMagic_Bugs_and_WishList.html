<h2>Current RM Bugs that particularly annoy me</h2>
<p>
Media Tab:<br/>
Left and right side panel selections in Media Tab not always synchronized.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
Add new media => Paste into field "Filename". If the path is enclosed with quotes, as from File Manager Copy as path command, the path is pasted numerous times and the add fails.
</p>
<br/>
<p>Text editing:<br/>
Editing in both database fields and Note editor.<br/>
Double click a word to select it, hit delete key to delete it => the cursor moves to incorrect location.
</p>
<p>
Note editor:<br/>
Assumes that typed text, e.g. &lt;b>, is formatting code.
Formatting codes should not be user enter-able in text mode. If formatting codes need to be visible, there should be a show formatting codes mode.<br/> 
Without the separation of modes, there is a class of text that the user is not allowed to use.
</p>
<p>
Fact description: <br/>
All characters after a "&lt;" are not displayed in person edit main panel.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
Merge Citations
<br/>
Open the Sources tab from the main window.<br/>
Select any source.<br/>
Open the selected source's list of citations.<br/>
Select any citation.<br/>
Select the Merge citations command from the three dot menu.<br/>
A list of all of the citations belonging to the selected source is displayed. As expected.<br/>
In the search box within the merge citations window, enter a broad search term, such as the letter 'a'.<br/>
A much larger list of citations with with to merge is displayed, mostly from other sources.<br/>
<br/>
Can one merge citations when they are from different sources? If only citations from sources based on the same Source Template were shown, that would make sense.
</p>



<h2>Design Change Wish List</h2>
<p>
RMNOCASE transparency <br/>
Either give a spec for a standalone collation sequence, <br/>
or use an off the shelf standard collation.
</p>
<p>
Groups and colors:<br/>
Assign colors to group definitions. (could be implemented in parallel with current color model to avoid shock to old time users)
</p>
<p>
Non-normalized data:<br/>
Get rid of non-normalized birth and death columns in person table.
</p>
<p>
Database indexes:<br/>
Add some referential integrity constraints in SQLite.<br/>
Add unique indexes that will enforce only one Primary for each fact/name.
</p>
<p>
Fact Type selection dialog<br/>
Don't populate Fact type list with a query every time. Its too slow as is to keep up with keyboard entry.
</p>
<p>
Sort children:<br/>
Use Birth Sort date for arranging children on screen and in reports.
</p>
<p>
Sort marriages:<br/>
Use Marriage Sort date for arranging marriages on screen and in reports.
</p>
<p>
Find person hot key:<br/>
add a hot key (keyboard shortcut), that will shift focus to the person index without filtering.
