<h2>1-  Thesaurus</h2>
Items sometimes are referred to by different names in different contexts<p/>
Here is a list of items that may be confusing.
<a href="RM_Thesaurus.html"><b>Thesaurus</b><a/>
<p/>
<p/>

<h2>2-  Sort date</h2>
Commonly misunderstood feature.<p/>
<img src="Fact_Dates.png" height="200"><p/>
The top circled field is the "normal date", the bottom one is the Sort Date.<p/>

The Sort Date is used to sort:
<ul>
<li>Facts in the fact list</li>
<li>Persons (offspring) in lists of a family's children by birth sort date (??)</li>
<li>Persons (spouses) in lists of a person's spouses (??) by marriage sort date (??)</li>
</ul>

Never displayed in reports.<br/>
Only used for sorting items in the RM display and in reports (??).<br/>

The sort date is, by default, set to the same value as the normal date (except for qualitative date modifiers)<br/>
<p/>

The sort date may be set to any desired value.<br/>


<h2>3-  Sorting multiple facts on the sane day</h2>

Dates in RM are are not TimeStamps and are limited to calendar dates. No clock time value is allowed.<br/>
<b>When more than one event occurs on the same calendar day and the order of the events is known, use the dashed sort date feature.</b><br/>

<p/>
For a clear explanation, see- <a href="https://help.rootsmagic.com/RM9/date-formats.html">RM v9 help: Date formats</a>,  last section: Sorting events on the same date<br/>
<p/>

Quick example-<br/>
The normal date values for the events may all be the same, but the sort date for each event would modified by adding -1, -2 -3 etc<br/>
For example, if four events happened on May 1, 1950, the sort dates are all by default, the same as the normal date: 1 May 1950. <br/>
Change the sort dates to:<br/>
1 May 1950-1<br/>
1 May 1950-2<br/>
1 May 1950-3<br/>
1 May 1950-4<br/>
The corresponding facts will be sorted accordingly.<br/>


<p/>
Note that the character entered by the user is the standard hyphen "-", but it is changed to an en-dash "–" when displayed. (Similar to how RM handles date ranges)<br/>

For info on dashes and hyphens, see <a href="https://www.scribbr.com/language-rules/dashes/">Em Dash (—) vs. En Dash (–)</a><p/>



<h2>-  Advanced Search primary field values</h2>
The Advanced Search feature in RM sets up a query using the user interface -
<img src="AdvSearch_Field.png" height="200"><p/>

The first field, at first glance, appears to be a list of all the fact types used in the database, standard and user created.
However, there are a number of items in the list that aren't facts-<p/>

Non-fact type items in the data (all that are not a specific fact)

Given name(s)<br/>
Given (or Nickname)<br/>
Surname<br/>
Surname (Birth or Marr)<br/>
Prefix<br/>
Suffix<br/>
Nickname<br/>
<p/>
Any Fact<br/>
Date edited<br/>
FamilySearch ID<br/>
Living flag<br/>
Number of children<br/>
Number of sets of parents<br/>
Number of siblings<br/>
