<h2>1-  Thesaurus</h2>
Software items are sometimes referred to by different names in different contexts<p/>
Here is a list of items that may be confusing.<br/>
<a href="RM_Thesaurus.html"><b>Thesaurus</b><a/>


<h2>2-  Sort date</h2>
Commonly misunderstood feature.<p/>
<img src="Fact_Dates.png" height="200"><p/>
The top circled field is the "normal date", the bottom one is the Sort Date.<p/>

The Sort Date is used to sort:
<ul>
<li>Facts in the fact list</li>
<li>Currently not used for Persons (offspring) in lists of a family's children by birth sort date</li>
<li>Currently not used for Persons (spouses) in lists of a person's spouses by marriage sort date (??)</li>
</ul>

It is never displayed in reports.<br/>
Only used for sorting items in the RM display and in reports (??).<br/>

The sort date is, by default, set to the same value as the normal date (except for qualitative date modifiers)<br/>
<p/>

The sort date may be set to any desired value.<br/>


<h2>3-  Sorting multiple facts on the sane day</h2>

Dates in RM are are not TimeStamps and are limited to calendar dates. No clock time value is allowed.<br/>
<b>When more than one event occurs on the same calendar day and the order of the events is known, use the dashed sort date feature.</b><br/>

<p/>
For a clear explanation, see- <a href="https://help.rootsmagic.com/RM9/date-formats.html">RM v9 help: Date formats</a>,  last section: Sorting events on the same date<br/>
<p/>

Quick example-<br/>
The normal date values for the events may all be the same, but the sort date for each event would modified by adding -1, -2 -3 etc<br/>
For example, if four events happened on May 1, 1950, the sort dates are all by default, the same as the normal date: 1 May 1950. <br/>
Change the sort dates to:<br/>
1 May 1950-1<br/>
1 May 1950-2<br/>
1 May 1950-3<br/>
1 May 1950-4<br/>
The corresponding facts will be sorted accordingly.<br/>


<p/>
Note that the character entered by the user is the standard hyphen "-", but it is changed to an en-dash "–" when displayed. (Similar to how RM handles date ranges)<br/>

For info on dashes and hyphens, see <a href="https://www.scribbr.com/language-rules/dashes/">Em Dash (—) vs. En Dash (–)</a><p/>



<h2>4-  Advanced Search primary field values</h2>
The Advanced Search feature in RM sets up a query using the user interface -<br/>
<img src="AdvSearch_Field.png" height="200"><p/>

The first field, at first glance, appears to be a list of all the fact types used in the database, standard and user created. However, there are a number of items in the list that aren't facts.<br/>
They are listed her for reference.<p/>

Non-fact type items in the data (all that are not a specific fact)<br/><br/>

Given name(s)<br/>
Given (or Nickname)<br/>
Surname<br/>
Surname (Birth or Marr)<br/>
Prefix<br/>
Suffix<br/>
Nickname<br/>
<p/>
Any Fact<br/>
Date edited<br/>
FamilySearch ID<br/>
Living flag<br/>
Number of children<br/>
Number of sets of parents<br/>
Number of siblings<br/>
Number of spouses<br/>
Record number<br/>
Sex<br/>
Source (family)<br/>
Source (general)<br/>
<br/>

<h2>6-  Adding media files after browser download</h2>
These instructions are for the current version (20023-10) of Chrome. Probably similar for Edge.<br/>

When a file is downloaded in Chrome, a small pop up window appears near the upper right corner of the browser window. This is shown after the file save dialog.<br/>
<img src="Chrome_File_DownLoad.png" height="200"><p/><br/><br/>
If one has the RM "Media=>Add Media=>Drop New Media" "drag and drop target" displayed, one can drag the small pop-up window onto the RM drop target to add the downloaded file to RM media.
This window disappears as soon as any action other than dragging is taken, like switching windows, clicking in the browser etc. So if the RM drop target is not already visible on the screen, the window will vanish before you can set it up. No worries- instead, set up the RM drop target, position the window so it will be visible when the focus is switched to the browser, and then in the browser, click the "downloads" button. This will display a list of recent downloaded files. You can drag the listed file that you want to the RM drop target.<br/>

This illustrates the dragging of a file in the Downloads list to the RM Drop Media Target area.<br/><br/>

<h2>7-  Opening a second instance of the same database</h2>
RM is not designed to do this. In fact it is designed to prevent this. SQLite has no problem with multiple processes accessing the same file, Database writes are serialized by using file locking.<br/>
There are easy workarounds to RM's prohibition to opening the same file twice but one will encounter numerous "file locked" error messages. I have not seen any problems caused by this, but it does not inspire confidence.<br/>
A simple and robust alternate method is to take a recent copy of the database file, rename it to something like "COPY YYYY-MM-DD.rmtree" and change its properties to Read Only.<br/>
Then when you want to see a part of the database that is inaccessible, one can open this Read Only "COPY" database in the same instance of RM. It won't be current, but for many situations, that will be OK<br/>
You won't be able to make accidental changes to the Read Only database, so that will ease your mind.<br/>
<br/>

Unfortunately, a modal window, citation entry, for example, will still prevent you from interacting with the other database's windows. You'll need a real second instance of RM to overcome that. But perhaps the COPY database window can be arranged on the screen to be visible while working in the modal window.<br/>
