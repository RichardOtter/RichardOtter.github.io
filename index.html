<h4><a href="tips/RootsMagic_Tips_and_Tricks.html">RootsMagic Tips and Tricks</a></h4>
<p>
A collection of ideas and investigations regarding RootsMagic (RM) genealogy project management software.
</p>
<p>
I use RM on Windows, but most items will also apply to the MacOS version.

<a href="https://zapier.com/blog/how-to-download-from-github/">Here.</a> is a nice explanation on how to download a single file or a collection of files from Github.
