<h2>Current RM Bugs that particularly annoy me</h2>
<p>
Media Tab:<br/>
Left and right side panel selections in Media Tab not always synchronized.
</p>
<p>
Text editing:<br/>
Editing in both database fields and Note editor.<br/>
Double click a word to select it, hit delete key to delete it => the cursor moves to incorrect location.
</p>
<p>
Note editor:<br/>
Assumes that typed text, e.g. &lt;b>, is formatting code.
Formatting codes should not be user enter-able in text mode. If formatting codes need to be visible, there should be a show formatting codes mode.</br> 
Without the separation of modes, there is a class of text that the user is not allowed to use.
</p>
<p>
Fact description: <br/>
All characters after a "&lt;" are not displayed in person edit main panel.
</p>

<h2>Design Change Wish List</h2>
<p>
RMNOCASE transparency <br/>
Either give a spec for a standalone collation sequence, <br/>
or use an off the shelf standard collation.
</p>
<p>
Groups and colors:<br/>
Assign colors to group definitions. (could be implemented in parallel with current color model to avoid shock to old time users)
</p>
<p>
Non-normalized data:</br>
Get rid of non-normalized birth and death columns in person table.
</p>
<p>
Database indexes:<br/>
Add some referential integrity constraints in SQLite.</br>
Add unique indexes that will enforce only one Primary for each fact/name.
</p>
<p>
Fact Type selection dialog<br/>
Don't populate Fact type list with a query every time. Its too slow as is to keep up with keyboard entry.
</p>
<p>
Sort children:<br/>
Use Birth Sort date for arranging children on screen and in reports.
</p>
<p>
Sort marriages:<br/>
Use Marriage Sort date for arranging marriages on screen and in reports.
</p>
<p>
Find person hot key:</br>
add a hot key (keyboard shortcut), that will shift focus to the person index without filtering.
