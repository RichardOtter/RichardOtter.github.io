# RM Data Entry Guidelines

[Home](https://richardotter.github.io)

## Overview

These are **my** best practices. I'd be happy to get feedback about improvements.

Longer topics are split into two pages, one dealing with the RM Fact
and the other with the RM source and citation.
Most others will be covered by a single page.

### [Burial Fact](Burial.html)

Includes Cremation fact.

### [ChildParent Fact](ChildParent.html)

For documenting a persons's parents. This is the place to attach sources.

### [Census Fact](Census%20-%20Fact.txt)

Using shred facts.

### [Census Source](Census%20-%20Source.txt)

### [Ancestry.com](Ancestry.html)

Collection and user tree sources, not including DNA matches.

### [DNA Matches](DNA_match.html)

DNA match information entry procedures for Ancestry, MyHeritage and 23andMe.
