# RM Data Entry Guidelines

Most others will be covered by a single file.

Longer topics are split into two files, one dealing with the RM Fact and the other for the RM Source and Citation.

## [Census Fact](Census%20-%20Fact.txt)

## [Census Source/Citation](Census%20-%20SourceCitation.txt)

## [Ancestry.com](Ancestry.txt)
