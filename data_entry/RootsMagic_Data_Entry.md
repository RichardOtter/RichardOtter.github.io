# RM Data Entry Guidelines

Longer topics are split into two files, one dealing with the RM Fact and the other for the RM Source and Citation.
Most others will be covered by a single file.

## [Census Fact](Census%20-%20Fact.txt)

## [Census Source/Citation](Census%20-%20SourceCitation.txt) Census sources

## [Ancestry.com](Ancestry.html) Sources from Ancestry, both collections and user trees

## [DNA](DNA.txt)  How I enter my DNA match iniformation.
