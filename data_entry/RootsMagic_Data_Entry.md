# RM Data Entry Guidelines

[Home](https://richardotter.github.io)

Longer topics are split into two pages, one dealing with the RM Fact
and the other with the RM source and citation.
Most others will be covered by a single page.

## [Census Fact](Census%20-%20Fact.txt)

## [Census Source](Census%20-%20SourceCitation.txt)

## [Ancestry.com](Ancestry.html) Collection and user tree sources

## [DNA Matches](DNA_match.txt) DNA match information entry procedures
