CENSUS FACT/EVENT

Overview

While it is desirable to create a complete census fact with a fully done source and
manual transcription, the large amount of work means that the work needs to be prioritized.

Level of interest in the person being documented-
LOWEST
 _SUMMARY
 _SUUMARY-IMG		at least for cousins and parents and spouse.
 full entry			but _PARTIAL in terms of copying over the service's index info
 full entry			use just service's index info
 full entry			include RJO transcription

Description

Start here as it indicates which of the different styles of entry is used.

general format:
YYYY [entity] Census

[entity] is
US Federal
STATE_NAME State

gives, for example:
1940 US Federal Census
1925 New York State Census

Use US Federal Census for Hawaii as territory.
Indian territory- not yet standardized. 
    Will have "Indian" in description.

Can add more info at the end:

YYYY [entity] Census
YYYY [entity] Census _SUMMARY
YYYY [entity] Census _SUMMARY-IMG
YYYY [entity] Census _SUMMARY-INC
YYYY [entity] Census TODO use cit
YYYY [entity] Census - Veterans Schedules



case:
1940 [entity] Census
Full entry

case:
1940 [entity] Census _SUMMARY
see below. No citation created, but fact is shared to at least a subset. Note has link and household member list, and list of people not added to database.

case:
1940 [entity] Census _SUMMARY-IMG
As _SUMMAERY but the census image has been attached to the Census fact.
Aim for at least this level for blood relatives.

case:
YYYY [entity] Census _SUMMARY-INC
Same as summary, but also includes an incomplete census citation has been used for at least some of the appropriate places. Citation may or may not have image.
Not really helpful as one will have to figure out what's missing in order to complete the entry.


case:
1890 [entity] Census - Veterans Schedule
or some other 'Schedule'.
This is not an indication of completeness, but a different kind of census entry.
No other good place to place this info.
Needs more research on which schedules are available. Haven't seen many.
Schedules type appear to be only for US Federal.
The type of data is shown in the Source name. So maybe this should go away...

for 1930 census
to obtain NARA roll number
Copy to clipboard the FHL film number provided by ancestry in the 1930 census citation.
Go the FS and do a search on that film.
https://www.familysearch.org/search/catalog

Usually, there will be 2 results- one for the whole census year and one for the state. Open on the state result.
A number on entries will be displayed. 
Do a find on page for the film number in your clipboard.
If found, the entry has the NARA roll number.
If not found, go to the next page of results and re-do the find on page.

or
look at the image of FS, go to image ~2 on film strip, will have NARA roll number.
for 1930 from Ancestry cite NARA roll # & "(FHL 2339965)"
