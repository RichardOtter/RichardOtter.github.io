# Instructions for downloading a single file from GitHub.com without using git

This is not as obvious as you may hope, but is easy once you know how.

The link may show a folder of files or an individual file:

## A link to a GitHub folder will bring you to a page looking like this:

Click the file name that you wish to download.\
The file will be displayed in a line-numbered format.
Now click on the download button near the top right side of the window.

A copy of the "raw" file, the file without line numbers (as it is actually stored on the server)
will be downloaded to your specified location.

## A link to a GitHub file (FILE_LINK) will directly display the line-numbered format file.

Again, click the download button near the top right corner to bring it to your computer.
