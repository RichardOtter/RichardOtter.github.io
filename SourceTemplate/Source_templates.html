<h1>Some custom RootsMagic source templates</h1>

<p>
I have created custom templates for the sources to which I have 
large numbers of citations. Here are some examples.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="Ancestry-ST-info.html" >Ancestry.com (data collections)</a><br/>
<a href="US_Fed_Census-ST-info.html" >US Federal Census</a><br/>
<a href="Find_a_Grave-ST-info.html" >Find a Grave</a><br/>
</p>
<p>
The above links display pages with details on the particular source template. 
Those pages have direct download links for the RootsMagic .rmst file.
</p>
<p>
The .rmst file that can be imported into RM using the Import button in the Source Template list window.
Test the file first by importing to an new, empty RM database.
</p>
<p>
RM comes with a large selection of pre-made source templates, but
for the above sources I preferred to create my own.
</p>
<p>
I will describe the template by referring to the ".rmst" file that is created when exporting a template (available via download link above).
</p>
<p>
You may want to read this, a<a href="SourceTemplate-GUI-rmst-crossreference.html"> cross reference guide </a>describing how the source template fields in the RM GUI correspond to the .rmst file XML elements.
</p>

<h2> Open questions</h2>
<p>
Often, a citation will list a person's name and birth date. 
A question to consider is whether the name entered here is as it is written in the source or is as it is found in the RM database. Certainly, a name transcribed incorrectly by Ancestry shouldn't be used.
I decided to use the name as it is in the RM database because the name as it is in the source record can be found in other fields of the citation. 
Use just the part of the name that is in the source.
</p>
<p>
The same question involves the birth date entered in the citation.
</p>
<p>
(Records in RM 8 and later have a last edited date but it is not shown in the GUI.)
