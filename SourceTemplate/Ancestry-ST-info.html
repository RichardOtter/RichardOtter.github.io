<p>
For Ancestry, the dilemma to be solved was that the Source Citation provided by Ancestry for most collections were not good enough to use.
Of course, one could simply reference the Ancestry source web page, but that 
wouldn't provide any information on reliability of the source and relies 
on an Ancestry subscription for access.
</p>
<p>
The goal for the Ancestry template was to capture all of the info that 
Ancestry provided and later figure out what the footnote sentences should be. I think that I've now done that as well.
</p>
<p>
I decided to create two template for Ancestry collections- one for collection that deal with a single person such as birth, death etc and another that deals with two people such as marriage, divorce, etc.
</p>
<p>
I'll describe the Single person template first. 
</p>
<p>
This is the relevant part of the rmst file. I removed most end tags and empty tags. It is certainly no longer in correct XML syntax.
</p>
<p>
As an example, use the Ancestry source collection:  New York, New York, U.S., Birth Index, 1910-1965.
The main page is at:<br/>
<a href="https://www.ancestry.com/search/collections/61457/">New York, New York, U.S., Birth Index, 1910-1965</a>
