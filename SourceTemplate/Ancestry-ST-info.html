</p>
<p>
For Ancestry, the dilemma to be solved was that many of the Source Citations provided by Ancestry for most collections were not good enough to use as provided.
Of course, one could simply reference the Ancestry source web page, but that wouldn't provide any information on reliability of the source and relies on an Ancestry subscription for access.
</p>
<p>
The goal for the Ancestry template was to capture all of the information that Ancestry provided and later figure out what the footnote sentences should be. I think that I've now done that as well for many cases.
</p>
<p>
In order to get our terminology straight, let use an example from Ancestry, the collection named "New York, New York, U.S., Birth Index, 1910-1965". I will use the word "Source" to refer to the entire Ancestry collection of that name. RM sometimes uses the term Master Source. It's the same thing. The source's main page is at:<br/>
<a href="https://www.ancestry.com/search/collections/61457/">New York, New York, U.S., Birth Index, 1910-1965</a>
</p>
<p>
The Ancestry page where a particular person, or household, is listed in that source is called a Citation. RM sometimes uses the term Source Detail. It's the same thing. A example citation to the NY Birth index Source is:
<a href="https://www.ancestry.com/discoveryui-content/view/3335191:61457"> Birth index entry for Walter Otter</a>
</p>
<p>
This template creates a "Lumped" source, meaning that in RM, only one Source is created, but many RM citations are created under the main source. A S"split" source would put all of the information in the source record. A reference to each person in the collection would necessitate creation of abother source record. Each source would probably have only one citation.
</p>
<p>
Information about the Source is taken from the Source's main page, half way down the page, below the search fields, starting with "Source Information", and continuing with the section "About New York, New York, U.S., Birth Index, 1910-1965". Note the subsection in the About section labeled "Original data:". We will use that later.
</p>
<p>
I decided to create two template for Ancestry collections- one for collections that deal with a single person or household such as birth, death, census etc and another that deals with two equal people such as marriage, divorce, etc.
</p>
<p>
I'll describe the Single person template first. "_Ancestry Database-Single -L" (The -L indicates that this is a 'lumped' source, as opposed to a split source.) "_Ancestry Database-Double -L" is described later, below.
</p>

<br/>
This is the full contents of the Ancestry provided Source Citation. Not all collections have this info. It is often not very helpful, other times it is crucial.<br/>

To show what data this is referring to, here is a different example that actually has the Ancestry Source Citation data- <a href="https://www.ancestry.com/discoveryui-content/view/291511995:62308"> 1850 census entry for Walter Otter</a>
<br/>
Look in the Source tab in the center of the page, (next to the Detail tab). The first paragraph is labeled "Source Citation". If it exists for the citation being entered, that's what goes in into the SrcCitation field. <br/>
<br/>
Example SrcCitation = National Archives at Washington, DC; Washington, D.C.; Seventeenth Census of the United States, 1950; Year: 1950; Census Place: New York, Kings, New York; Roll: 2327; Page: 5; Enumeration District: 24-3136
