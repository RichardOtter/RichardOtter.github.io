===========================================DIV50==<br/>
NOTES:<br>
Untested assumptions on how these work:<p/>

The name fields can appear in any of the names attached to the person.
"Alternate name" is FactTypeID 900, not in the menu and is never used.<br/>
"Association" is FactTypeID 902 is bot related to the Associates feature, but is a standard fact.<br/>
