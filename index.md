## Topics

This site and its contents are a work in progress. 

The utilities listed below are ones that I've "released". That means that I've done a reasonable amount of testing, documentation is accurate, and I've included a single file exe version of the Python script so Python installation is not required.
The links provided point to down-loadable zip files that contain everything you need.

Others of these links (e.g. Genealogy standard forms, Sample SQL queries for use with Group creator utility, RootsMagic database table listing and notes) point to GitHub.com source files. 
[Here](https://zapier.com/blog/how-to-download-from-github/) is a nice explanation on how to download a single file or a collection of files from Github.
