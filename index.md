### [RootsMagic Tips and Tricks](tips/RootsMagic_Tips_and_Tricks.html)

A collection of ideas and investigations regarding RootsMagic (RM) genealogy project management software.

I use RM on Windows, but most items will also apply to the MacOS version.

Note: some of these links point to GitHub.com. One does not need a GitHub account to see and download files.
[Here](https://zapier.com/blog/how-to-download-from-github/) is a nice explanation on how to download a single file or a collection of files from Github.
